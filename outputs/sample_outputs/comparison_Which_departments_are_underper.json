    "detailed_analysis": "The performance scores reveal critical issues across the underperforming departments. Marketing's score of 58/100 reflects a significant shortfall in lead generation, with MQLs at only 72% of the target, which has direct implications for the sales pipeline (quarterly_review_presentation.pptx). Customer Support's score of 52/100 is alarming, particularly with a CSAT score that has dropped to 68% from 82%, indicating declining customer satisfaction and increased resolution times (quarterly_review_presentation.pptx). The HR department's turnover rate of 23% is a major concern, as it exceeds the target of 15%, suggesting a talent retention crisis that could impact overall organizational performance (quarterly_review_presentation.pptx). This turnover is compounded by compensation issues, as noted in the strategy notes, where compensation is reported to be below market rates, further exacerbating retention challenges (strategy_notes.docx). Overall, these departments require immediate strategic intervention to address their performance deficits and align with organizational goals."
