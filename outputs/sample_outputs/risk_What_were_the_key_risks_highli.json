    "detailed_analysis": "The risks identified in Q3 2024 reflect a multifaceted challenge for Adobe Inc. Client concentration remains a significant concern, as the top three clients contribute 35% of total revenue, which could jeopardize financial stability if any of these clients were to reduce their business. Cybersecurity risks were underscored by the OAuth vulnerability, which, while quickly addressed, indicates potential gaps in the company's security protocols that could lead to future incidents. Supply chain issues, particularly semiconductor shortages, have already deferred $2.1M in revenue, affecting 18 customers and highlighting the need for a more resilient supply chain strategy. Regulatory pressures are increasing with the EU Digital Services Act, requiring an additional compliance budget of $1.2M, which could strain resources. Finally, talent retention is a critical issue, with a turnover rate of 24.8%, particularly in engineering, where the loss of 18 senior developers could impact product development and innovation. Addressing these risks will require strategic initiatives across client diversification, cybersecurity enhancements, supply chain management, regulatory compliance, and talent retention strategies."
