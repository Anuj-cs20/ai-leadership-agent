   - Marketing-qualified leads at 72% of annual target
   - Digital advertising ROI declined from 4.2x to 3.1x
   - Root cause: over-reliance on paid channels, insufficient ABM investment

     AI triage deployment — total investment: $4.1M
   - Board concern: Risk of customer churn if CSAT drops below 65%.
     Estimated $28M renewal revenue at risk.

   - Organization-wide turnover at 23% vs. 15% target
